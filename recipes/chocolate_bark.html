        <p><em><strong>CHOCOLATE BARK WITH NUTS</strong></em></p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This chocolate bark recipe is so easy to make, and ready in a hurry! I typed up my favorite dark chocolate trail mix chocolate bark recipe below. Use this technique and change it up using the ideas provided within the post. Recipe yields about 25 pieces.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <p>12 ounces quality chocolate chips or chopped chocolate (I like bittersweet/about 60% cocao content)</p>
            <p>¾ cup raw nuts or seeds (choose from almonds, pecans, hazelnuts, pistachios and/or pepitas)</p>
            <p>¼ cup dried cranberries or other dried fruit (dried cherries, apricots and/or candied ginger—chopped if large)</p>
            <p>About ½ teaspoon flaky sea salt, optional</p>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <p>1.If you have time, toast the nuts/seeds: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Toast the nuts/seeds on a rimmed baking sheet until fragrant and turning lightly golden on the edges, about 6 to 9 minutes. Transfer the nuts to a cutting board and roughly chop them.</p>
            <p>2.In the meantime, melt the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second increments, stirring after each one. Don’t overdo it. The chocolate is done when it’s about 90% melted—keep stirring off the heat and the pieces should completely dissolve. (Alternately, you can use melt it in a heat-proof bowl set over a saucepan of gently simmering water.)</p>
            <p>3.Cover a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Use a silicone or rubber spatula to spread chocolate evenly over the center area of the baking sheet—aim for about ¼″ thickness (it won’t reach the edges).</p>
            <p>4.Sprinkle the nuts evenly over the chocolate, followed by the dried fruit. If you’re adding flaky salt, crush it between your fingers as you sprinkle it over the chocolate. Lightly use your palms to press the toppings into the chocolate.</p>
            <p>5.If you’re in a hurry, place the pan on a flat surface in the refrigerator to harden for about 15 minutes. If you’re not, let the chocolate cool at room temperature for 2 to 4 hours, until completely hardened.</p>
            <p>6.Once the chocolate is completely hardened, use your hands to break it into about 25 pieces. Serve immediately, or cover and store at room temperature for up to 1 week.</p>
        </ol>
